Revision of the manuscript entitled â€œCNN-based Post-filtering for Image Quality Enhancement" submitted for publication to IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (IEEE ICIP) 2021.
Following the reviewers request, a comparison with HEVC will be added in the manuscript. IQE-CNN provides BD-Rate grains of around 52.33% over HEVC and average BD-PSNR improvement of 3.3246 dB.
Figures 3 and 4 in the manuscript will be updated as shown below.
